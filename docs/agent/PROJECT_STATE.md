# Project State

Updated: 2026-07-27

## Current status

- Calcsheet quotation-history pricing is complete and committed through `3344577`.
- Add Product keeps managed **Pricelists** separate from read-only **Quotation History**.
- Historical product search, provenance display, expected-purchase-date handling, and contingency suggestions are implemented across the Express API and React UI.
- Server integrity checks reject unrelated or blank confirmed candidates and invalid/pre-quotation purchase dates.
- Customer PDF/XLSX exports do not include internal historical pricing snapshots.

## Verification

- Server product-history tests: 36/36 passing.
- Frontend tests: 73/73 passing.
- TypeScript and production build passing.
- Local Firestore-emulator search, suggestion, validation, and browser smoke passed.
- Independent final review verdict: READY.

## Current blockers

- None for this feature.

## Next considerations

- Deploy or merge according to the repository branch workflow when requested.
- Consider improving the insufficient-history panel to show excluded evidence reasons; this is explanatory polish, not a correctness blocker.
